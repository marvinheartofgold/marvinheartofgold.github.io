    <h4>A Home After School</h4>

    <p>Started in 1982, GSSC provides after&hyphen;school care for students at Marymount Convent School. Although 
      there are a few students who pay full rates, the majority rely on government subsidies based on means testing. 
      We serve a hot meal to the children when they arrive a few minutes after dismissal from school, and afternoon 
      tea after completing some supervised homework. We also provide an array of interesting activities. GSSC maintains 
      a holistic and formative environment for the child&apos;s development which aims to:
      <ol>
        <li>inculcate respect, love and tolerance in the child towards self and others;</li>
        <li>build emotional resilience in the child to face future challenges; and</li>
        <li>instil self&hyphen;acceptance and understanding of oneself.</li>
      </ol> 
    </p>

          <b>Gardening</b>
          <p>Together with GSSC staff, the students maintain a mini garden on the grass patch behind the centre. 
            This has led to a new&hyphen;found passion for gardening in some, who eagerly await the time to water 
            plants, sow seeds, and nurture their green thumbs.</p>
     
          <b>Arts &amp; Craft Programmes</b>
          <p>Through arts and craft, the children gain new knowledge while honing their creative skills. They were 
            thrilled to showcase their handiwork to their loved ones when their works were exhibited at the end of 
            the year, with many parents leaving notes of encouragement and gratitude to the staff.</p>
