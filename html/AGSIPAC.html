    <h1>Ahuva Good Shepherd &hyphen; Interim Placement and Assessment Centre (AGS&hyphen;IPAC)</h1>
    
    <p><i>Protected and Nurtured</i></p>

    <h2>Standing In And Bridging The Gap</h2>

    <p>AGS&hyphen;IPAC opened in June 2015. Most of the children, ranging from 4 to 16 years old, have 
      experienced some form of abuse, often in their family homes. While the Ministry of Social and Family 
      Development (MSF) Child Protection Services conduct investigations and work with various services to 
      explore the next form of permanent placement for the child (such as kinship care, foster families, 
      and children&apos;s home), AGS&hyphen;IPAC provides a transitory safe place for the child, between 
      the child&apos;s family home and the next safe permanent placement. A typical length of stay is 30 days.</p>
      
    <p>These children usually suffer from traumatic stress and are in a high state of anxiety and have 
      difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviours. Some are clingy and fearful, others act out 
      with aggression and most have sleep problems. We patiently walk with them, lovingly assuring 
      them that there is hope and light at the end of their present dark and fearsome tunnel. As we 
      journey with these children, we are humbled by their resilience and courage.</p>
