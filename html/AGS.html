    <h4>Ahuva Good Shepherd &hyphen; Children&apos;s Home (AGS&hyphen;CH)</h4>
    
    <p><i>Soar Like an Eagle</i></p>

    <p>AGS&hyphen;CH provides a safe and nurturing residential environment for girls, aged 4 to 18, 
      who have experienced challenges in their families, like financial difficulties, 
      family violence, divorce, abuse and parents&apos; incarceration.
    </p>

    <p>Set up in 2006, AGS&hyphen;CH provides a safe and nurturing residential environment for girls, aged 4 to 18. 
      They have experienced challenges in their families, like financial difficulties, divorce, family violence, abuse 
      and parents&apos; incarceration.</p>
      
    <p>We journey with each child in her healing process and develop a care plan that 
      recognizes her uniqueness and worth. Often, they have suffered immense pain, brokenness and fragility. Through 
      specially designed programmes, activities and therapeutic interventions, we strive to assuage their physical, 
      psychological and emotional pains. The girls find their inner strengths, build self-confidence, self-esteem, 
      dignity, resilience, and learn to trust and hope again. Very often, they develop new interests through our 
      support in education, sports and social activities.</p>
    
    <p>We aim to reintegrate them into society healed, and prepared to be contributing members of society.</p>

    
    <h4>Ahuva Good Shepherd &hyphen; Interim Placement and Assessment Centre (AGS&hyphen;IPAC)</h4>
    
    <p><i>Protected and Nurtured</i></p>

    <p>AGS&hyphen;IPAC provides a safe place for children, aged 4 to 16, who have experienced some form of 
      abuse, while investigations and assessments take place and long-term care 
      arrangements are made. A typical length of stay is 30 days.
    </p>

    <p>AGS&hyphen;IPAC opened in June 2015. Most of the children, ranging from 4 to 16 years old, have 
      experienced some form of abuse, often in their family homes. While the Ministry of Social and Family 
      Development (MSF) Child Protection Services conduct investigations and work with various services to 
      explore the next form of permanent placement for the child (such as kinship care, foster families, 
      and children&apos;s home), AGS&hyphen;IPAC provides a transitory safe place for the child, between 
      the child&apos;s family home and the next safe permanent placement. A typical length of stay is 30 days.</p>
      
    <p>These children usually suffer from traumatic stress and are in a high state of anxiety and have 
      difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviours. Some are clingy and fearful, others act out 
      with aggression and most have sleep problems. We patiently walk with them, lovingly assuring 
      them that there is hope and light at the end of their present dark and fearsome tunnel. As we 
      journey with these children, we are humbled by their resilience and courage.</p>


    <h4>Ahuva Good Shepherd &hyphen; Small Group Care (AGS&hyphen;SGC)</h4>
  
    <p><i>Reintegration With Resilience</i></p>

    <p>AGS&hyphen;SGC provides a safe place for girls, aged 7 to 12, who have been assessed by the Ministry of Social and 
      Family Development (MSF) to have moderate to high needs due to past abuse. The usual length of stay 
      is up to 18 months.
    </p>

    <p>Since June 2017, AGS&hyphen;SGC has been providing a safe place for girls, aged between 7 and 12 years, 
      who have been assessed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to have moderate to high 
      needs due to past abuse.</p>
      
    <p>Many, if not all of the children, arrive at AGS&hyphen;SGC with broken spirits and heavy hearts. They 
      have experienced abuse in one form or another. For these young survivors of abuse and trauma, individual 
      care plans delivered by staff trained in trauma&hyphen;informed care in a warm and loving home setting 
      with fewer residents (15 maximum) is more conducive for their healing and recovery. The usual length of 
      stay is up to 18 months.</p>

          <b>Workshops and Programmes</b>
          <p>Throughout the year, a range of workshops, such as animal encounters held by the Singapore Zoo, are
