    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    
    <p>
    In response to a request from the Singapore Government to help care for troubled girls in Singapore, December 1939 
    saw the arrival of two Irish Good Shepherd sisters. The Good Shepherd Sisters opened their doors in February 1940 
    to women and girls who were troubled or abused and in need of healing and reconciliation. Although many are 
    familiar with the name, <q>Marymount</q> as a road and an MRT station are named after it, we have been housed 
    in various locations, including a camp in Bahau, Malaysia during the Japanese occupation.
