    <h2>The Journey</h2>

    <p>Set up in 2006, AGS&hyphen;CH provides a safe and nurturing residential environment for girls, aged 4 to 18. 
      They have experienced challenges in their families, like financial difficulties, divorce, family violence, abuse 
      and parents&apos; incarceration.</p>
      
    <p>We journey with each child in her healing process and develop a care plan that 
      recognizes her uniqueness and worth. Often, they have suffered immense pain, brokenness and fragility. Through 
      specially designed programmes, activities and therapeutic interventions, we strive to assuage their physical, 
      psychological and emotional pains. The girls find their inner strengths, build self-confidence, self-esteem, 
      dignity, resilience, and learn to trust and hope again. Very often, they develop new interests through our 
      support in education, sports and social activities.</p>
    
    <p>We aim to reintegrate them into society healed, and prepared to be contributing members of society.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Programmes</h2>

    <h3>Outings</h3>

    <p>Staff and volunteers often bring the children out to explore, from visiting new attractions such as 
      Jewel Changi Airport and Gardens by the Bay, to going to the movies to catch new releases.</p>

    <h3>Workshops and Programmes</h3>

    <p>Throughout the year, a range of workshops, such as animal encounters held by the Singapore Zoo, are 
      organised for the children. Pet Therapy programmes are also organised for the children.</p>
