    <h2>Dearly Loved</h2>

    <p>Since June 2017, AGS&hyphen;SGC has been providing a safe place for girls, aged between 7 and 12 years, 
      who have been assessed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to have moderate to high 
      needs due to past abuse.</p>
      
    <p>Many, if not all of the children, arrive at AGS&hyphen;SGC with broken spirits and heavy hearts. They 
      have experienced abuse in one form or another. For these young survivors of abuse and trauma, individual 
      care plans delivered by staff trained in trauma&hyphen;informed care in a warm and loving home setting 
      with fewer residents (15 maximum) is more conducive for their healing and recovery. The usual length of 
      stay is up to 18 months.</p>
