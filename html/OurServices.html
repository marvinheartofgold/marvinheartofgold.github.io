          <p><i>Good Shepherd Centre (GSC)</i>
            offers a safe place for women and their children experiencing family violence, and other 
            women facing seemingly insurmountable difficulties in their lives. Through a wide range 
            of programmes to support them in their healing, we empower them to tap on their inner 
            strength and resources to rebuild their lives and create a future for themselves and 
            their families. GSC is appointed by the Singapore Government to provide victim care for 
            women who have been trafficked into Singapore.
